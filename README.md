# Thank You

> For the bored user.

Thank You is a self-contained and harmless mock-virus made to show gratitude to the user. All of the virus's file manipulations are done in the directory of the executable, and it doesn't make any other changes to, or collect any information from the "host".

## Why

You might be amused to see what type of stuff it does. Think of it as a "coffee break" from your works.

## Installation

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/clabe45/thank-you/releases).

## Usage

```
./thank-you
./thank-you clean   # reverts changes
```

## Final Note

Don't forget to say *thank you*!
